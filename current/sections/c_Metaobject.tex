\label{concept-Metaobject}

A \meta{object} is a stateless anonymous type generated by the compiler
(when requested by the programmer through the \texttt{reflexpr} operator),
providing metadata reflecting a specific program feature.

\input{sections/t_is_metaobject.tex}

\input{sections/c_Metaobject_def.tex}

The following operations are defined for each type satisfying the \meta{object}
concept.

\input{sections/c_Metaobject_opers.tex}

The templates returning source information for for built-in types and other
such base-level constructs which are declared internally by the compiler
should return an empty string as a source file path and zero as source file
line and column.
