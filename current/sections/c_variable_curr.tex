\subsection{MetaVariable}
\label{concept-MetaVariable}

\meta{Variable} is a \meta{NamedScoped} reflecting a variable\footnote{
at the moment only a class data member}.

In addition to the requirements inherited from \meta{NamedScoped}, the following must
be satisfied:

The \verb@category@ template class specialization for a \meta{Variable} should
inherit from \verb@variable_tag@:

\begin{minted}{cpp}
template <>
struct category<MetaVariable>
 : variable_tag
{ };
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{\texttt{type}}

A template class \verb@type@ should be added and should inherit
from a \meta{Type} reflecting the type of the variable:

\begin{minted}{cpp}
template <typename T>
struct type;

template <>
struct type<MetaVariable>
 : MetaType
{ };
\end{minted}

\texttt{Note:} if the type used in the declaration of the variable
is a \verb@typedef@ then the specialization of \verb@type@ for
a \meta{Variable} reflecting the said variable, should
inherit from a \meta{Typedef}\footnote{in other words reflection
should be aware of \texttt{typedef}s and unlike the "base-level" C++
is should distinguish between a typedef and its underlying type}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{pointer}}

If the reflected variable is a class member variable (i.e. if the \meta{Variable}
is also a \meta{ClassMember}), then the \verb@pointer@ template class should be
defined as follows:

\begin{minted}{cpp}

template <>
struct pointer<MetaVariable>
{
	typedef typename original_type<type<MetaVariable>>::type
		_mv_t;
	typedef typename original_type<type<scope<MetaVariable>>>::type
		_cls_t;

	typedef _mv_t _cls_t::* type;

	static type get(void);
};

\end{minted}

\textbf{Note:} The static member function \verb@get@ should return a data member pointer to
the reflected member variable. The \verb@_mv_t@ and \verb@_cls_t@ typedefs
are implementation details and are not a part of this specification.
