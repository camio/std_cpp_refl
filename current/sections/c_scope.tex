\subsection{MetaScope}
\label{concept-MetaScope}

\meta{Scope} is a \meta{NamedScoped} reflecting program constructs defined inside
of a named or anonymous scope (like the global scope, a namespace, a class, etc.)

In addition to the requirements inherited from \meta{NamedScoped}, the following is required:

The \verb@is_scope@ template class specialization for a \meta{Scope} should
inherit from \verb@true_type@:

\begin{minted}{cpp}
template <>
struct is_scope<MetaScope>
 : true_type
{ };
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{\texttt{members}}

A template class \verb@members@ should be defined and should inherit from a
\concept{MetaobjectSequence} containing \meta{NamedScoped} metaobjects reflecting
the members of the base-level scope reflected by this \meta{Scope}.
Note that at this point, for \meta{Scope}s reflecting namespaces and enums
\verb@members@ should return an empty \concept{MetaobjectSequence}, until the
issue of how their members are reflected is resolved.


\begin{minted}{cpp}
template <typename T>
struct members;

template <>
struct members<MetaScope>
 : MetaobjectSequence<MetaNamedScoped>
{ };
\end{minted}
