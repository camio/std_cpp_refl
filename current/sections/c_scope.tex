\subsection{MetaScope}
\label{concept-MetaScope}

\meta{Scope} is a \meta{NamedScoped} reflecting program constructs defined inside
of a named or anonymous scope (like the global scope, a namespace, a class, etc.)

In addition to the requirements inherited from \meta{NamedScoped}, the following is required:

The \verb@is_scope@ template class specialization for a \meta{Scope} should
inherit from \verb@true_type@:

\begin{minted}{cpp}
template <>
struct is_scope<MetaScope>
 : true_type
{ };
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{\texttt{members}}

A template class \verb@members@ should be defined and should inherit from a
\concept{MetaobjectSequence} containing \meta{NamedScoped} metaobjects reflecting
the members of the base-level scope reflected by this \meta{Scope}.

Furthermore the boolean \verb@All@ parameter (defaulting to \verb@false@ if not specified)
should control which scope members are listed in the resulting metaobject sequence.

If \verb@All@ is 
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb@true@, then all members should be listed,
\item \verb@false@, then the following scope member should {\em not} be included:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item private or protected class members,
	\item scope members with identifiers starting with an underscore followed by a
	(uppercase or lowercase) letter,
	\item scope members annotated by a generalized attributes as hidden (for example
	\verb@[[mirror::hidden]]@ or \verb@[[reflection::hidden]]@).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\begin{minted}{cpp}
template <typename T, bool All=false>
struct members;

template <>
struct members<MetaScope, true>
 : MetaobjectSequence<MetaNamedScoped> // all members
{ };

template <>
struct members<MetaScope, false>
 : MetaobjectSequence<MetaNamedScoped> // only 'visible' members
{ };
\end{minted}
