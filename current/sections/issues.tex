\section{Known issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\em The reflection of C++11/14 features not covered by this proposal}.

\item {\em Explicit specification of what should be reflected}. It might be useful to have
the ability to explicitly specify either what to reflect or what to hide from reflection.
For example the "whitelisting" (explicitly specifying of what should be reflected) of namespace
or class members could simplify reflective meta-algorithms so that they would not have
to implement complicated filters when traversing scope members, to hide implementation details and
to improve compilation times. It is important that this functionality is decoupled from the
scope member declarations, since it would allow applications to cherry-pick what should be
reflected even in third-party libraries.

\end{itemize}
