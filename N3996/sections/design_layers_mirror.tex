\subsubsection{Mirror}

Mirror is a compile-time functional-style reflective programming library,
which is based directly on the basic metadata and is suitable for generic programming,
similar to the standard \verb@type_traits@ library.

Mirror is the original library from which the Mirror reflection utilities started.

It provides a more user-friendly and rich interface than the basic-metaobjects.
and a set of metaprogramming utilities which allow
to write compile-time meta-programs, which can generate efficient
and optimized program code using only those metadata that are required.

The appendix~\ref{appendix-mirror-examples} contains several (rather simple) examples of usage
and the functional style of the algorithms based on metadata provided by Mirror.
