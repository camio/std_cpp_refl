\subsection{Meta-ClassMember}
\label{concept-Meta-ClassMember}

A \meta{ClassMember} is a \meta{Scoped} reflecting a class member.

\input{sections/c_ClassMember_trait.tex}
\input{sections/c_ClassMember_def.tex}
\input{sections/c_ClassMember_opers.tex}

The \texttt{is\_public} trait only indicates whether we are breaking encapsulation
by looking at the class member. The exact access type will be reflected by
a {\em Meta-Specifier} which will be introduced in a future revision of this
proposal.
