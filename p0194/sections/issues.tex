\section{Known issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Reflection of \texttt{union}s -- should we add a \em{Meta-Union} or
handle unions together with classes.}

\item{Should \meta{GlobalScope} also conform to the \meta{Namespace} concept?}

\item{Since we can have different metaobjects reflecting different redeclarations
of the same thing, there should be a way to traverse the chain of these metaobjects,
in the direction from the \say{newest} to the \say{oldest}.}

\item{Interaction with generalized attributes.}

\end{itemize}
