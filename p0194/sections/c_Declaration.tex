\subsection{Meta-Declaration}
\label{concept-Meta-Declaration}

A \meta{Declaration} is a stateless anonymous type generated by the compiler
(when requested by the programmer through the 
\hyperref[section-reflection-operator]{\texttt{reflexpr} operator}),
providing metadata reflecting a specific program feature.

\input{sections/t_is_metaobject.tex}

\input{sections/c_Declaration_def.tex}

The following operations are defined for each type satisfying the \meta{Declaration}
concept.

\input{sections/c_Declaration_opers.tex}

The templates returning source information for for built-in types and other
such base-level declarations which are declared internally by the compiler
should return an empty string as a source file path and zero as source file
line and column.
