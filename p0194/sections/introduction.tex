\section{Introduction}

In this paper we propose to add native support for
compile-time reflection to C++ by the means of compiler generated
types providing basic metadata describing various program constructs.
When finalized, these metaobjects, together with some additions to the standard
library can later be used to implement other third-party libraries
providing both compile-time and run-time high-level
reflection utilities.

In this paper we propose to add as the first phase
only a subset of the metaobjects, which we assume to be essential
and which provide a good starting point for future extensions.

Please refer to the previous papers \cite{n3996,n4111,n4451,n4452}
for the motivation for this proposal, including some examples,
design considerations and rationale. In \cite{ITFPWTHOR} a complex use-case
for a static reflection is described.
