\section{Impact on the standard}

This proposal requires the addition of a new operator
\texttt{reflexpr} with fairly simple rules for its operands,
which {\em may} cause conflicts with identifiers in existing code.

However, we have performed a simple analysis on \num{903} third-party, open-source
repositories\footnote{Only original repositories, not forks.}
hosted on \url{http://github.com/}, where we counted identifiers
in the C++ source files. We have found \num{599080707} instances of
\num{7525668} {\em distinct} words matching to the C++ identifier rules.
We have found {\em zero} occurences of \say{reflexpr}.

No other changes to the core language are required, especially no new rules
for template parameters. The metaobjects can be implemented by (basically) regular
types and the interface is implemented by regular templates.
A lazy implementation may require the addition of several compiler builtin
operators similar to those already used for the type-traits, but other
implementations are possible.
