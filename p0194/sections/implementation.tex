\section{Experimental implementation}

A fork of the clang compiler with a partial experimental implementation
of this proposal can be found on github \cite{clang-reflexpr-impl}.
The modified compiler can be built by following the instructions listed
in \cite{clang-getting-started}, but instead of checking out the official clang
repository, the sources on the \texttt{mirror-reflection} branch of the modified
repository should be used.

All examples listed in Appendix \ref{section-reflexpr-examples} are working with
the modified compiler.
