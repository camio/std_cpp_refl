\section{Concept specification}
\label{section-current-Concepts}

We propose that the basic metadata describing a program written
in C++ should be made available through a set of {\em anonymous} types
defined by the compiler and through related functions and template classes.
At the moment these types should describe only the following program
declarations: namespaces\footnote{in a limited form}, types, typedefs,
classes and their data members and enum types.

In the future, the set of metaobjects should be extended to reflect
class inheritance, free functions, class member functions, templates,
template parameters, enumerated values, possibly the C++ specifiers, etc.

The compiler should generate metadata for the program declarations
in the currently processed translation unit, when requested by the invocation
of the reflection operator. Members of ordered sets (sequences) of metaobjects,
like scope members, parameters of a function, base classes, and so on, should be listed
in the order of appearance in the processed translation unit.

Since we want the metadata to be available at compile-time,
different base-level declarations should be reflected by
{\em statically different} metaobjects and thus by {\em different} types.
For example a metaobject reflecting the global scope namespace should
be a different {\em type} than a metaobject reflecting the \verb@std@
namespace\footnote{this means that they should be distinguishable for
example by the \texttt{std::is\_same} type trait},
a metaobject reflecting the \verb@int@ type should
have a different type then a metaobject reflecting the \verb@double@
type, etc.

This section describes\footnote{in pseudo-code} a set of metaobject concepts
and their requirements, traits for metaobject classification and operations
providing the individual bits of meta-data.

Unless stated otherwise, all proposed named templates described below should
go into the \verb@std::meta@ nested namespace in order to contain reflection-related
definitions and to help avoiding potential name conflicts.
