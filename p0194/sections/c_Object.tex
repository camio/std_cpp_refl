\subsection{Meta-Object}
\label{concept-Meta-Object}

A \meta{Object} is a stateless anonymous type generated by the compiler
(at the request of the programmer via the invocation of the
\hyperref[section-reflection-operator]{\texttt{reflexpr} operator}),
providing metadata reflecting a specific program declaration.

Concrete types modelling this concept should be \texttt{constexpr} default-
and copy-constructible.

\input{sections/t_is_metaobject.tex}

\input{sections/c_Object_def.tex}

The following operations are defined for each type satisfying the \meta{Object}
concept.

\input{sections/c_Object_opers.tex}

The returned instance of \texttt{std::source\_location} should be \texttt{constexpr},
and even the source file name and function name strings should be compile-time constants.

The source information for built-in types and other
such implicit declarations which are declared internally by the compiler
should return an empty string as the function name and source file path and
zero as the source file line and column.
