\section{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to Ricardo Fabiano de Andrade for suggesting the name \verb@unreflexpr@ for
the \hyperref[fut-reverse-reflection]{reverse reflection operator} and
suggested some of its use cases.

Also thanks to Roland Bock for suggesting an important feature, that can be
used together with identifier-generation -- variadic composition and its use cases.
