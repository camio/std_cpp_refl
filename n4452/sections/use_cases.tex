\section{Use cases}
\label{section-use-cases}

This section describes several common use-cases of reflection ranging from trivial to fairly advanced.
These use-cases mostly require only a limited reflection support as proposed in N4451.
Appendix~\ref{appendix-other-use-cases} contains
several additional use-cases which are less common or require advanced reflection features.
