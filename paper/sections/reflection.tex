\section{Reflection operator}

The metaobjects reflecting some program feature \verb@X@ as
described above should be made available to the user by
the means of a new operator or expression.
More precisely, the reflection operator returns a type conforming to a particular
metaobject concept, depending on the reflected expression.

Since adding a new keyword has the potential to break existing code,
we do not insist on any particular expression, here follows a list of options
in order of preference (from the most to the least preferrable):

\begin{itemize}
\item{\verb@mirrored(X)@}
\item{\verb@reflected(X)@}
\item{\verb@reflexpr(X)@}
\item{\verb@|X@}
\item{\verb@[[X]]@}
\item{\verb@<<X>>@}
\end{itemize}

The reflected expression \verb@X@ in the items listed above can be any of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\verb@::@} -- The global scope, the returned metaobject is a {\meta{GlobalScope}}.
\item{{\em Namespace name}} -- the returned metaobject is a {\meta{Namespace}}.
\end{itemize}
