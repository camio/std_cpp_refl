\subsection{MetaScoped}
\label{concept-MetaScoped}

{\em MetaScoped} is a \meta{object} reflecting program constructs defined inside
of a named scope (like the global scope, a namespace, a class, etc.)

In addition to the requirements inherited from \meta{object}, the following requirements must
be satisfied:

The \verb@has_scope@ template class specialization for a {\em MetaScoped} should
inherit from \verb@true_type@:

\begin{lstlisting}
template <>
struct has_scope<MetaScoped>
 : true_type
{ };
\end{lstlisting}

A template class \verb@scope@ should be defined and should inherit from the
\meta{Scope} which reflects the parent scope of the program construct reflected
by this {\em MetaScoped}.

\begin{lstlisting}
template <typename T>
struct scope;

template <>
struct scope<MetaScoped>
 : MetaScope
{ };
\end{lstlisting}
