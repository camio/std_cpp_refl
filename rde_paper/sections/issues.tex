\subsection{Anonymous declarations}

\textbf{Q:} {\em How should anonymous namespaces, nested structs, unions or
the global scope for that matter be reflected?}

\textbf{A:} In our opinion all such declarations should be reflected by
metaobjects which are not \meta{Named}.

So for example the \meta{GlobalScope} is a \meta{Namespace}, but
the \verb@has_name@ trait should return \verb@false@ and the \verb@get_name@
operation would be either undefined or return an empty string.

On the other hand, even anonymous namespaces, classes or unions are scopes,
so the metaobjects reflecting them should conform to the \meta{Scope} concept.

Same reasoning applies to anonymous namespaces, nested structs or unions.

\subsection{Interaction with concepts and attributes}

TODO.
