\subsubsection{Lagoon}

Lagoon defines run-time polymorphic interfaces and classes implementing these
interfaces and wrapping the compile-time metaobjects from Mirror and Puddle.
While Rubber is more suitable for simple decoupling of reflection-based
algorithms from the real types of the metaobjects that the algorithms
operate on, Lagoon is full-blown run-time reflection utility that can be
even decoupled from the application using it and loaded dynamically on-demand.

See appendix~\ref{appendix-lagoon-examples} for examples of usage.
