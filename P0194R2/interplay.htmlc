<h2>Interplay with other proposals</h2>

<p>This proposal relies on the Concepts TS, including a resolution to its
<a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/concepts-ts/ts-active.html#29">Issue 29</a>.
It assumes that WG21 will find a solution for compile-time
strings; until then, this proposal provides a placeholder one (see
[refl.ops.str]) to be able to reason about the interfaces.
