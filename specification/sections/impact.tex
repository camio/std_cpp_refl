\section{Impact On the Standard}

The impact on the standard and the existing applications depends
mainly on the method of reflection (functions vs. operators).
Reflection functions pose a very small risk of breaking existing
standard-conforming code. The \verb@mirrored@ operator on the other
hand has a considerable potential of breaking existing applications.
This can be alleviated by using existing keywords like \verb@%@
as suggested above.

Since compilers already have all the metadata required to generate
the proposed metaobjects, making them available to programmers
should not pose a big problem to the compiler vendors.
