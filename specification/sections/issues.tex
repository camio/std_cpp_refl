\section{Unresolved Issues}

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\em Normalization of names returned by \verb@Named::base_name()@\\and \verb@Named::full_name()@:}
	The strings returned by the \verb@base_name@ and \verb@full_name@ functions should be
	implementation-independent and the same on every platform/compiler.
	
	\item {\em Returning names as compile-time strings:} It would be advantageous if even
	the names of various metaobjects were compile-time constants and could be introspected
	or used as template parameters. See for example the Mirror's compile-time strings~\cite{mirror-ct-strings}.

	\item {\em Annotation base-level program constructs with tags and relations}.

	\item {\em Explicit specification of what should eb reflected}. It might be useful to have
	the ability to explicitly specify either what to reflect or what to hide from reflection.
	This might be a separate feature, but it also could be merged with the tagging functionality.
