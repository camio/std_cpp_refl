\subsubsection{Rubber}

Rubber is a OOP-style run-time type erasure utility built on top
of Mirror and Puddle. It again follows the metaobject concept hierarchy of Mirror and Puddle.
Rubber allows to access and store metaobjects of the same category in a single
type, so in contrast to Mirror and Puddle where a meta-type reflecting the \verb@int@
type and a meta-type reflecting the \verb@double@ type have different types
in Rubber they can both be stored in a variable of the same type.
Rubber does not use virtual functions but rather pointers to existing
functions implemented by Mirror to achieve run-time polymorphism.

For examples of usage see appendix~\ref{appendix-rubber-examples}.
