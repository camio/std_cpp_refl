\section{Implementation hints}

\subsection{Generation of metaobjects}

The metaobjects should be generated / instantiated by the compiler only
when explicitly requested. This also applies to members of the metaobjects. For example when a {\metaobject Namespace}
reflecting the \verb@std@ namespace is generated the individual \verb@member(...)@
functions (and the resulting metaobjects) should {\em not} be generated automatically
unless the \verb@Scope::member(...)@ function is called or its type queried (by \verb@decltype@
or otherwise).

This should probably improve the compilation times and avoid reflection-related
overhead when reflection is not used.
