\subsection{Metaobject Concepts}

In the proposed solution the metadata describing a program written
in C++ would be made available through a set of anonymous types (classes)
defined by the compiler. These classes would describe various program
constructs like, namespaces, types, typedefs, classes, their member variables
(member data), member functions, inheritance, templates, template parameters,
etc.

This section rescribes a hierarchy of concepts (static interfaces) for these
metaobjects. The concepts described here would not exist as concrete
types and would not be defined by the standard library or compiler. They
only describe which member typedefs, member functions, etc. are available
for various kinds of metaobjects.
