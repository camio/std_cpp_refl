\section{Introduction}

Reflection and reflective programming can be used
for a wide range of tasks such as implementation of serialization-like operations,
remote procedure calls, scripting, automated GUI-generation,
implementation of several software design patterns, etc.
C++ as one of the most prevalent programming languages 
lacks a standardized reflection facility.

In this paper we propose the addition of native support for
compile-time reflection to C++ and a library built
on top of the metadata provided by the compiler.

The basic static metadata provided by compile-time reflection
should be as complete as possible to be applicable in a wide
range of scenarios and allow to implement custom higher-level
static and dynamic reflection libraries and reflection-based
utilities.

The term \emph{reflection} refers to the ability of a computer program
to observe and possibly alter its own structure and/or its behavior.
This includes building new or altering the existing data structures,
doing changes to algorithms or changing the way the program code
is interpreted. Reflective programming is a particular kind
of \emph{metaprogramming}.

The advantage of using reflection is in the fact that everything
is implemented in a single programming language, and the human-written
code can be closely tied with the customizable reflection-based
code which is automatically generated by compiler metaprograms,
based on the metadata provided by reflection.

The solution proposed in this paper is based on the
\href{http://kifri.fri.uniza.sk/~chochlik/mirror-lib/html/}{\em Mirror}
reflection utilities~\cite{mirror-doc-cpp11} and on several years
of user experience with reflection-based metaprogramming.
