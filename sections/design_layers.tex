\subsection{Layered approach and extensibility}

The purpose of this section is to show that a {\em static} $\to$ {\em dynamic}
and {\em basic} $\to$ {\em complex} approach in designing reflection
can accomodate a wide variety of programming styles and is arguably
the "best" one. We do not propose to add all layers described
below into the standard library.

The Mirror reflection utilities \cite{mirror-doc-cpp11} on which this
proposal is based, implements several distinct components which
are stacked on top of each other. From the low-level metadata, through
a functional-style compile-time interface to a completely dynamic
object-oriented run-time layer (all described in greater detail below).

\subsubsection{Basic metaobjects}
The very basic metadata, which are in Mirror
provided (registered) by the user (or an automated command-line tool) via a set
of preprocessor macros. This approach is both inconvenient and error-prone
in many situations, but also has its advantages.

We propose that a standard compiler would make these metadata available
to the programmer through the static basic metaobject interfaces. These would
serve as the basis for other (standard and non-standard) higher-level
reflection libraries and utilities.

In the Mirror utilities the basic metadata are not used directly by
applications.
